  <div class="description">If you belong to a gym or tune in to the health community, chances are you’ve heard the term “counting macros.”

Popularly used by people looking to shed weight or gain muscle mass, counting macronutrients (macros) can help you reach various health goals.

It entails keeping track of the calories and types of foods you eat in order to achieve certain macronutrient and calorie goals.

Though counting macros is relatively simple, it can be confusing if you’re just starting out.

This article explains the benefits of counting macros and provides a step-by-step guide on how to get started.
In order to successfully count macronutrients, it’s important to know what they are and why some people need different macronutrient ratios than others.

Carbohydrates

</div>
<div class="description1">Carbohydrates include sugars, starches and fibers .

Most types of carbs get broken down into glucose, or blood sugar, which your body either uses for immediate energy or stores as glycogen — the storage form of glucose — in your liver and muscles.

Carbs provide 4 calories per gram and typically make up the largest portion of people’s calorie intake.

Carb intake is among the most hotly debated of all macronutrient recommendations, but major health organizations suggest consuming 45–65% of your daily calories from carbs (2Trusted Source).

Carbohydrates are found in foods like grains, starchy vegetables, beans, dairy products and fruits.

Fats
</div>
<div class="description2">Fats have the most calories of all macronutrients, providing 9 calories per gram.

Your body needs fat for energy and critical functions, such as hormone production, nutrient absorption and body temperature maintenance (3Trusted Source).

Though typical macronutrient recommendations for fats range from 20–35% of total calories, many people find success following a diet higher in fat.

Fats are found in foods like oils, butter, avocado, nuts, meat and fatty fish.

Proteins
</div>
<div class="description3">Like carbs, proteins provide 4 calories per gram.

Proteins are vital for processes like cell signaling, immune function and the building of tissues, hormones and enzymes.

It’s recommended that proteins comprise 10–35% of your total calorie intake (4Trusted Source).

However, protein recommendations vary depending on body composition goals, age, health and more.

Examples of protein-rich foods include eggs, poultry, fish, tofu and lentils.
