  <div class="description">The answer to this question depends on numerous factors, including your age, height, current weight, activity level, and metabolic health, among several others.

When trying to lose weight, a general rule of thumb is to reduce your calorie intake to 500 fewer calories than your body needs to maintain your current weight. This will help you lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body weight per week.

Below are average calorie ranges that consider these factors.</div>
<div class="titel1">
Women

</div>
<div class="description1">The average, moderately active woman between the ages of 26–50 needs to eat about 2,000 calories per day to maintain her weight and 1,500 calories per day to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight per week.

Women who are active and walk more than 3 miles per day will need to consume 2,200 calories or more daily to maintain their weight and at least 1,700 calories to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight per week.

Young women in their early 20s have higher calorie needs. They require about 2,200 calories per day to maintain their weight.

Women over age 50 generally require fewer calories. The average moderately active woman over 50 needs about 1,800 calories per day to maintain her weight and 1,300 calories per day to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week.

These estimates do not apply to women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, as they have significantly higher calorie needs.

<div class="titel2">
Men
</div>
<div class="description2">The average, moderately active man between the ages of 26–45 needs 2,600 calories per day to maintain his weight and 2,100 calories per day to lose 1 (0.45 kg) pound per week.

Active men who walk more than 3 miles per day may require 2,800–3,000 calories per day to maintain their weight and 2,300–2,500 calories per day to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of weight per week.

Young men ages 19–25 have higher energy needs. They require an average of 2,800 calories per day to maintain their weight and up to 3,000 if they’re active. To lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week, moderately active young men should consume 2,300–2,500 calories daily.

Energy needs decrease as men age. Between the ages of 46–65, moderately active men need an average of 2,400 calories per day. After 66 years, the average man’s calorie needs decrease to about 2,200 calories per day.


</div>
<div class="titel3">
Children
</div>
<div class="description3">Children have widely varying calorie needs based on their age, size, and activity level.

Whereas the average toddler requires 1,200–1,400 calories per day, the average moderately active teenager requires 2,000–2,800 calories per day. Active teenage boys require even more.

Children who are growing and developing normally and engage in regular physical activity usually don’t need to count calories. When they’re provided with a range of healthy options to eat, most moderately active kids naturally eat the amount of food their body requires.
